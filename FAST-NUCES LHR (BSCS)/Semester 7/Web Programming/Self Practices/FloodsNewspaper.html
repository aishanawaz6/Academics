<td rowspan=5 width=500> Floods affected at least 33 million people and killed at least 1,739 from the beginning of monsoon season in mid-June 2022 to Nov. 18, 2022.
20.6 million people required humanitarian assistance.
According to the post-disaster needs assessment, the flooding caused $14.9 billion in damages and $15.2 billion in economic losses. Estimated needs for rehabilitation and reconstruction in a resilient way are at least $16.3 billion.
The UN’s development agency, UNDP, said an additional nine million people risk being pushed into poverty on top of the 33 million affected by the devastating floods.
Almost 10.5 million people in Pakistan are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity between April to October 2023. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh provinces are the most at risk of acute food insecurity.
More than 1.2 million livestock were killed during the 2022 monsoons, with severe repercussions on the livelihoods of affected households and the supply of animal products, including milk and meat.
Despite the passage of nearly a year since the floods, Pakistan is currently facing an imminent nutrition crisis, which has been aggravated by pre-existing high rates of malnutrition in flood-affected regions. Of particular concern is the increasing malnutrition among young children, as undernutrition accounts for nearly half of all deaths in children under five.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the first spell of monsoon rains in Pakistan during the period of 25 June to 10 July has resulted in 86 deaths, 151 injuries, damage to 97 houses, and the loss of 46 livestock. In Punjab province, Lahore City witnessed an exceptional volume of rainfall, setting a record for the highest levels observed in the past three decades. With over 200 mm of rainfall, the city faced significant urban flooding.

<td width=400> According to officials, the floods affected nearly 15% of Pakistan’s rice crop and 40% of its cotton crop.
The floods displaced at least 7.9 million people. In 2023, many displaced people have started to return to their places of origin, but they are returning to challenging circumstances.
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), an estimated total of 318,829 temporary displaced persons were identified during a Community Needs Identification (CNI) conducted between January and March 2023 in 19 assessed districts of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The Pakistan 2022 Floods Response Plan was jointly launched on Aug. 30, 2023, by the government of Pakistan and the UN. A revised Floods Response Plan was released on Oct. 4, 2023, and sought $816 million to provide humanitarian assistance to 9.5 million people.
The southern provinces of Pakistan received more than 350% of average precipitation in July and August based on the 2001–2021 mean

<td width=400> According to the Pakistan Education Sector Working Group, the floods affected 2.2 million children and damaged a total of 34,204 schools in 126 districts. As of early March 2023 there was a 40% gap in funding and low coverage to support school rehabilitations.
According to UNOCHA in their Feb. 6, 2023 Situation Report, “An estimated 3.5 million children, especially girls, are at high risk of permanent school dropout. 
The Pakistan flood of 2022 received a considerable attention. However, the causes and implications of the events have not been examined. Using observations, satellite data, and reanalysis products, we show that the event was caused by multiday extreme rainfall on wet antecedent conditions. The extreme rainfall was associated with the two atmospheric rivers that transported significant moisture from the Arabian Sea.

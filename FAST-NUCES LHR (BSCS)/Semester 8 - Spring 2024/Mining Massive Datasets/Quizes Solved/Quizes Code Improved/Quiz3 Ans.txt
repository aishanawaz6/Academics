Question 1 (a): Generate Signature Matrix
                 Docs

Permuations      D1 D2 D3 D4 
P1               1  6  1  1
P2               1  2  1  1
P3               2  3  2  2
P4               1  4  1  1

b) Jaccard Sim (Boolean Matrix)
i. 1/5 
ii. 4/5
iii. 4/5

c) Jaccard Sim (Signatures)
i. 0/4
ii. 4/4 =1
iii. 4/1 =1

d) Similar Documents have similar signatures
e) No its very ineffecient, Permuatating even once is prohibited. We use alternative method of hashing row index
